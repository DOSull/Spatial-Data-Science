title: Introducing spatial data science
---

These materials introduce 'spatial data science' or might also be considered a course in 'advanced GIS' which is what it was developed to be when it was Geog 315 at Victoria University of Wellington.

I am happy to discuss developing any or all of these materials into short intensive one/two/three day courses to suit the needs of organisations grappling with connecting their geospatial and data analytics workflows.
