# Global UFO sightings
Hurrah! A reprieve for the UFO data, with the added bonus that the dataset is now global...

These data were [retrieved from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings), where you will find out more about how they were collated. You might want to sign up at Kaggle to retrieve the smaller version of the data available at the site (the 'scrubbed' version). There are at least some sightings in the complete dataset at lat-lon 0, 0 (so-called [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)&mdash;not a real place...).


These data are shown in this previously [rather wonderful web map](https://metrocosm.com/ufo-sightings-map.html). It's no longer as wonderful as it was because it looks like the basemap access token for Mapbox expired. There's a [much less cool map here](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=6cd609921ebc44ff914a4e8059813b16). There are several examples of things people have done with these data at the Kaggle page.

Anyway, you'll find the data themselves at [this link](world-ufo-sightings.gpkg?raw=true).

## Other data
To explore the data with respect to general population patterns and avoid [this problem](https://xkcd.com/1138/) you will need more general demographic and other data available. For New Zealand you can get those from the [census data page](aotearoa-new-zealand-census-data.md). Global population is trickier, although you can get some [fairly generic data here](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/), or if you want to focus on the US (where the UFO data are likely uh... let's say... less unreliable), then give the US Census download approach described on [this page](us-census-data.md) a try.
