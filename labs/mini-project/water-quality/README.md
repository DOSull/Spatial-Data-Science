# Determinants of water quality
The aim of this project would be to look at possible determinants of water quality at catchment levels.

## Data
A couple of different dimensions of water quality as measured by nitrogen levels or by presence of _E. Coli_ are available from these links.

+ [Nitrogen in waterways](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/search/?q=nitrogen)
+ [E. coli](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/layer/52698-median-escherichia-coli-concentration/)

These can be related to different catchments, which are available at a range of scales and levels of detail [here](https://data.mfe.govt.nz/search/?q=Catchments).

## Ideas
The approach would be to consider one or other of the measures of pollution in relation to the relative area of catchment occupied by a variety of landuses. Landuses are included in the landcover database:

+ [LCDB](https://lris.scinfo.org.nz/)

Some simple examples of outcomes from analysis of this kind can be seen on this [Statistics NZ web page](https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/river-water-quality-nitrogen).
