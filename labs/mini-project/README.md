# Mini-projects
Datasets for the mini-project are linked below with project-specific datasets in the first section, and collections of more general datasets that might be relevant to more than one project in the second section.

I am also open to any suggestions you might have for projects you'd like to pursue on any other topic. Given the nature of the course, you will need to have a pretty good idea of where you will be sourcing relevant (spatial) data, but other than that I am open to reasonable suggestions&mdash;just get in touch so we can discuss your ideas.

**In all cases, I strongly advise that you anticipate difficulties and challenges working with any of these and don't leave downloading them until the last minute! Please plan ahead!**

## Submission requirements
You should submit a document (PDF preferred) conforming with the requirements set out in [this document](guidance-on-mini-project-report.html "guidance on the mini-project report write-up") to the dropbox provided on Nuku by the end of the day on **{{ site.data.dates.assignment_5 }}**.

<!-- delete submission date from this page, or make sure it matches the schedule! -->

Note that if you compile your report using _Rmarkdown_ (which I recommend)  then you should still submit it in PDF format (Knit to Word, then convert to PDF).
