# Zealandia mouse trapping data 2003-14
This [archive file](zealandia-data.zip?raw=true) contains data relating to mouse trapping along four trap lines in the Zealandia reserve carried out from 2003 to 2014. Initially this was part of the pest-removal effort that went into establishing the reserve, while later years were aimed at monitoring any return of mice.

The archive contains a number of spatial datasets relating to the fence line, public paths, locations of seats and benches, the streams and lakes/wetlands in the reserve, as well as the trap lines (`mouse-index-lines.gpkg`) and the locations of the traps (`mouse-index-stations.gpkg`). In addition I have provided a detailed digital elevation model for the reserve area (`zealandia.tif`).

Finally the non-spatial dataset `trap-line-data.csv` contains information from the surveys. The data should be relatively self-explanatory but record information about each individual mouse trapped with date and location information. These data would need to be joined to the index stations data (and this will involve some data cleaning to make table joins possible).

Once the data are assembled, it should be possible to develop simple statistical models of mouse abundance (in the early years of the project) or of mouse incursions (if any) in later years, in relation to possible environmental factors (proximity to water, elevation, likely sunlight, proximity to paths, proximity to the fence etc.)

If you think it will be helpful I can provide additional documents relating to the project, on request.
